# Refresher for SOLID

A hands-on C++ workbook revisiting the five SOLID design principles.  
Each principle lives in its own folder with:

- A **README.md** defining the principle, key terms, use cases, benefits, and when to use/not to use.  
- A pair of code examples:  
  1. A simple “violation” (pre-refactoring) showing the problem.  
  2. An SOLID-compliant refactoring demonstrating the correct structure.

## Prerequisites

Before you dive in, you should be comfortable with:

- **C++ Classes & Objects**: definition, constructors, destructors  
- **Encapsulation & Access Control**: `public`/`private`/`protected`  
- **Inheritance & Polymorphism**: virtual methods, overriding, up-casting  
- **Abstract Base Classes**: pure-virtual functions, interfaces  
- **Composition vs. Inheritance**: “has-a” vs. “is-a”  
- **Coupling & Cohesion**: what makes a class loosely coupled and highly cohesive  

### You can refer to the OOPs_Prequisite file (present in md/docx format) for the same.
